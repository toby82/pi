About Me:

A raw beginner in many ways but an old one, I'm a retired languages teacher with no technical background or qualifications. I started with Atari Basic and BBC Basic in 1983, in my mid-30s. Later, I dabbled in Flash Actionscript for quite a while , mostly to make resources for language learning/teaching.

I bought a Pi. I've never done any soldering so I bought a Berryclip. Never done any Python, but I very quickly got to like its "natural" uncomplicated syntax and power. I don't suppose that's unusual!

Anyway, this is my first go at Python and GPIO with Berryclip. I am not yet into tkinter so I just used the shell and the Berryclip, and also I couldn't see a cross-platform way to get key presses without <Enter>. So it is a very simple thing and an example of a beginner's learning process.

About Berryclip Bookies for Python 2.7:

Simple horse racing simulators have been around forever - no claims to originality!

- 6 horses in every race, each with appropriate name and odds
- "cyclical" betting routine uses Berryclip leds and switch
- fixed bet amount (can be changed in the code)
- simple race progress display in Shell and also via Berryclip leds
- totally random winner
- race until you get fed up or run out of funds
- final feedback

I've learned quite a bit so far and had a lot of fun - thanks, Matt!
Still a raw beginner, so if anyone reading this has any tips for improvements, please email me: jim@dastor.org.uk
